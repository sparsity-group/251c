# Prerequisites

This course assumes familiarity with core signal-processing concepts at the
undergraduate level in both the discrete-time and continuous-time settings such
as stability, convolutions, sampling, and aliasing. On the discrete-time side,
familiarity with z-transforms, discrete-time Fourier transforms, discrete
Fourier transforms, finite-impulse response filters, and infinite-impulse
response filters is expected.  On the continuous-time side, familiarity with
continuous-time Fourier transforms and Fourier series is expected. For the
project, familiarity with MATLAB or Python may be useful.
