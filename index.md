# Prerequisites

This course assumes familiarity with core signal-processing concepts at the
undergraduate level in both the discrete-time and continuous-time settings such
as stability, convolutions, sampling, and aliasing. On the discrete-time side,
familiarity with z-transforms, discrete-time Fourier transforms, discrete
Fourier transforms, finite-impulse response filters, and infinite-impulse
response filters is expected. On the continuous-time side, familiarity with
continuous-time Fourier transforms and Fourier series is expected. For the
homework and project, familiarity with MATLAB or Python will be useful. At UCSD,
the prerequisite material is covered in ECE 101 and ECE 161A.

# Course Grade

The course grade will be based on an in-class midterm **(30%)** and a project
**(70%)**. Homeworks (and solutions) will be handed out periodically, but will
not be collected. It is suggested that you complete the homework assignments to
prepare for the midterm.

# Academic Integrity

[UCSD's Code of Academic Integrity](https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/) applies
to this course. It is dishonest to cheat on exams, copy other people's work, or
fake experimental results. An important element of academic integrity is fully
and correctly acknowledging any materials taken from the work of others.
Instances of academic dishonesty will be referred to the Office of Student
Conduct for adjudication.
