## Prerequisites
This course assumes familiarity with core signal-processing concepts at the
undergraduate level in both the discrete-time and continuous-time settings such
as stability, convolutions, sampling, and aliasing. On the discrete-time side,
familiarity with z-transforms, discrete-time Fourier transforms, discrete
Fourier transforms, finite-impulse response filters, and infinite-impulse
response filters is expected. On the continuous-time side, familiarity with
continuous-time Fourier transforms and Fourier series is expected. For the
homework and project, familiarity with MATLAB or Python will be useful. At UCSD,
the prerequisite material is covered in ECE 101 and ECE 161A.
